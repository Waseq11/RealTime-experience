Hello,
This is a simple project inspired by an idea that I wanted to do.
Basically it's a website with two buttons. The Red button leads to my original project which is "Real time experience"
and the Blue button leads to the google page. I used HTML,CSS and little bit of JS to code the two pages. 
Index1.html is the page with the two buttons
Index2.html is the page with the coding of the "Real time experience".
I linked them.
Thank you
